abstract = {We propose a novel learning approach based on differential geometry to extract and encode important characteristics of a set of trajectories captured through demonstrations. The proposed approach represents the trajectories using a surface in Euclidean space. The surface, which is called Canal Surface, is formed as the envelope of a family of regular implicit surfaces (e.g. spheres) whose centers lie on a space curve. Canal surfaces extract
the essential aspects of the demonstrations and retrieve a generalized form of the trajectories while maintaining the extracted constraints. Given an initial pose in task space, a new trajectory is reproduced by considering the relative ratio of the initial point with respect to the corresponding cross-section of the obtained canal surface. Our approach produces a continuous representation of the set of demonstrated trajectories which is visually perceivable and easily understandable even by non-expert users. Preliminary experimental results using simulated and real-world data are presented.},

	abstract = {Sampling-based kinodynamic planners, such as the popular RRT algorithm, have been proposed as promising solutions to planning for systems with dynamics. Nevertheless, complex systems often raise significant challenges. In particular, the state-space exploration of sampling-based tree planners can be heavily biased towards a specific direction due to the presence of dynamics and underactuation. The premise of this paper is that it is possible to use statistical tools to learn quickly the effects of the constraints in the algorithm{\textquoteright}s state-space exploration during a training session. Then during the online operation of the algorithm, this information can be utilized so as to counter the undesirable bias due to the dynamics by appropriately adapting the control propagation step. The resulting method achieves a more balanced exploration of the state-space, resulting in faster solutions to planning challenges. The paper provides proof of concept experiments comparing against and improving upon the standard RRT using MATLAB simulations for (a) swinging up different versions of a 3-link Acrobot system with dynamics and (b) a second-order car-like system with significant drift.},
